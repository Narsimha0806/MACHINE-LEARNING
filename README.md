# Machine Learning Project - Linear Models for Regression and Classification

This repository contains implementations of **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** from scratch as part of the project. The models are trained on the **Iris dataset** and evaluated based on mean squared error (MSE) for regression tasks and classification accuracy for classification tasks.
